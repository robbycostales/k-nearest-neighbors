# k-nearest-neighbors
Clusters vectors of arbitrary length by k-nearest neighbors algorithm

# NOTE
This program was build specifically for a certain project.
While some variable names may be specific to that project, the functions can
be used more generally.
I do plan on going back later an generalizing the variable names. But for now... on to bigger things!
